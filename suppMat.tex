\section{Material and Methods}
\subsection{Reporters, Molecular Biology and Growth Conditions}
\subsubsection{Reporters}
The [\emph{pUBQ10::H2B-RFP / pUBQ10::YFP-PIP1;4 / pGATA23::nls-GUS-GFP}] reporter used for imaging was generated by crossing the Wave138Y line (\emph{pUBQ10::YFP-PIP1;4} \cite{Geldner:2009bc}) to a line expressing [\emph{pUBQ10::H2B-RFP - pGATA23::nls-GUS-GFP}]. The [\emph{pUBQ10::H2B-RFP - pGATA23::nls-GUS-GFP}] line was obtained by supertransformation of a \emph{pUBQ10::H2B-RFP }cassette in a background expressing \emph{pGATA23::nls-GUS-GFP} \cite{DeRybel:2010ic}. For imaging of the \emph{aur1-2/2-2} double mutant, \emph{aur1-2/2-2} plants expressing a \emph{pPIN1::PIN1-GFP} cassette \cite{Lucas11032013} were supertransformed by a \emph{pUBQ10::H2B-RFP} cassette. 

\subsubsection{Molecular Biology}
The \emph{pUBQ10::H2B-RFP }cassette was obtained by Gateway-mediated cloning of a stop-less Histone H2B (AT5G22880) cDNA cassette in a \emph{pUBQ10::\emph{Gateway-cassette}:RFP }destination vector \cite{Grefen:2010ho}.

\subsubsection{Growth Conditions}
Before imaging plants were grown vertically on 0.5X MS plates. The plates were prepared as follow: 2.66 g Murashige and Skoog medium (M0222.0050, LOT no. P08381.01, Duchefa, Haarlem, Netherlands), 0.97 g MES (2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid buffer, M3671-50G, LOT no. 120M5433, Sigma-Aldrich) and 10 g Saccharose (4621.1, LOT no. 330160546, Carl Roth, Karlsruhe, Germany) were diluted in 1 L of sterile de-ionized water. The pH was adjusted to 5.8 using KOH. 15 g Phytagel were added to the bottle before autoclaving. Plates were poured once autoclaving was done. The seeds were surface sterilized by a (10 \% Sodiumhypochloride, 0.1 \% TRIS, in water) solution in a microtube for 10 min (shaker) and then rinsed five times with sterile water. Single seeds were sowed side by side on 0.5X MS plates with at least 1 cm space in between to facilitate sample preparation. Plates were grown for 5 to 7 days under long day conditions (16h/8h day/night cycle) with 120-140 $\mu$mol/m\textsuperscript{2}/s amount of light, at 22$\degree $C.

\subsection{Light Sheet Fluorescence Imaging}
\subsubsection{Sample Preparation}
Capillaries (3 mm in diameter, 30 mm in height - Hilgenberg GmbH, Malsfeld, Germany) and carbon rods (0.28 mm in diameter, 30 mm in height, from Conrad Electronic GmbH \& Co KG, Wels, Germany) were cleaned in an ultrasound unit with 2\% Hellmanex (Hellma GmbH \& Co. KG, Muellheim, Germany) for 10 min, rinsed with water several times and then autoclaved. For sample preparation, the capillary was pushed 1.5 mm deep into the Phytagel to about 10 mm below the root tip, slid carefully over the root until the capillary reached the leaves and then lifted from the plate. The capillary was pushed into Phytagel to fill the capillary. A carbon rod was inserted from the top, behind the plant. The capillary was pushed into Phytagel in order to extrude the plant up to the region of interest (0 - 4 mm above the edge of the capillary). A supplementary video illustrating the sample preparation procedure is available (see Supplemental movies \ref{sec:suppmovies}). A drop of 2\% Agarose (no. 6351.2, Carl Roth, Karlsruhe, Germany) was placed above the region of interest in order to mount the root onto the Phytagel. Until imaging, the plants were kept in custom made chambers made by a 10 mm segment of the large end of a 200 $\mu$L pipet tip glued into the lid of a 15 mL tube.

\subsubsection{Imaging}
The plant was placed vertically in the 0.5X MS-filled chamber with the leaves in the air. It was inserted from above but held from below. During imaging the plant was illuminated by a flexible glass fiber (1/2 inch in diameter) that guided standard fluorescent light above the plant (120-140 $\mu$mol/m\textsuperscript{2}/s). A shutter on this illumination device is operated by the data acquisition software of the LSFM to turn the light off whenever a stack of fluorescence images is recorded, a standard time switch for the lamp generates the diurnal cycle. The microscope chamber was perfused continuously (0.55 ml/min) with fresh 0.5X MS medium and maintained at 23$\degree $C.

Two colour channels were recorded, GFP and YFP were excited by a 488nm diode laser, fluorescence emission was filtered with a 525/50 band-pass filter. RFP was excited by a 561nm diode-pumped solid state (DPSS) laser, the fluorescence emission was filtered with a 607/70 band-pass filter. Image stacks consisting of 233 planes with an axial pitch of 0.645 $\mu$m were recorded every 5 min. A Carl Zeiss N-Achroplan 40x/0.75 W objective lens was used in the detection path and a Carl Zeiss EC Plan-Neofluar 5x/0.16 served in the illumination path. An Andor Clara camera (6.45 $\mu$m pixel pitch) was driven in a binning (2x2) mode. Camera exposure time was between 30 ms and 75 ms, the laser intensity was set between 0.02 mW and 0.6 mW depending on the respective fluorescence intensity. The detailed individual settings of each recording can be found in Table~\ref{tab:metadata}.

\subsubsection{Image Processing}
Images were stored in 16-bit lossless Tagged Image File Format (TIFF). The complete four-dimensional dataset ($x,y,z,t$) was loaded in \textit{Fiji} (\href{http://fiji.sc/Fiji}{http://fiji.sc/Fiji}) as virtual hyperstack via the Bio-Formats Importer plugin (\href{http://fiji.sc/Bio-Formats}{http://fiji.sc/Bio-Formats}). The hyperstack was registered using the Fiji plugin \textsl{Correct 3D drift}
(\href{http://fiji.sc/wiki/index.php/Correct_3D_drift}{http://fiji.sc/wiki/index.php/Correct\_3D\_drift}) which registers the time points using the phase correlation algorithm based on the intensity of the membrane channel. The dataset was then cropped to the region containing the lateral root primordium along the x-, y- and z-directions. The three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction in Figure 1B (main text) was performed with \textit{Arivis} (\href{http://www.arivis.com}{http://www.arivis.com}).

\section{The Virtual Lateral Roots (VLR)}
\subsection{Nuclei Segmentation and Tracking}
\label{sec:segmentation}
\noindent
The nuclei were segmented and tracked manually for each dataset by means of an in-house \textit{Mathematica} (\href{http://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/}{http://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/}) program. This tool provides an interactive visual representation of the 3D datasets over time. The user can manually track the spatial position and lineage of individual cell nuclei. For each marked cell nucleus the program stores a unique identifier, the spatial position, the time point and a list holding the identification numbers of its parent cells. Cell nuclei are marked at two time points: right after the division in which the cell is born (or the very first appearance of a founder cell) and right before the cell divides (or the last time point analysed). The positions in between are interpolated linearly. Segmentation and tracking were realized for the first 24 hours of lateral root development and the resulting data was exported to a file in tabular format for further data processing and analysis (see supporting datasets in Section~\ref{sec:datasets}). We thereby created a total of five virtual lateral root (VLR) datasets that store all information about cell nuclei positions, lineages and cell divisions. Figure~\ref{fig:allTrees} shows the reconstructed cell lineage trees for all five datasets with nodes coloured according to the underlying division types. The classification of division types is explained in Section~\ref{sec:divisionTypes}.

In \textit{Mathematica}, we grouped the cell lineages that belong to the same cell file and assigned each cell nucleus in a file a unique colour (see Figure 1D, main text). In this context, we define the \textit{master cell file} as the one that swells the most and label it with index \textbf{0} \TODO{@Alexis: put reference here about the article that refers to the swelling (?)}. In the radial view, cell files to the left were assigned negative indices (\textbf{-1, -2, -3}), whereas cell files to the right were assigned positive indices (\textbf{+1, +2, +3}) (see Figure 1C, main text). The cell file assignment for each cell nucleus is added to the VLR datasets.

\subsection{Registration of Datasets}
\label{sec:registration}
\noindent
In order to compare all five datasets of the VLR with each other we require a spatial and a temporal registration of the datasets. 

\subsubsection{Spatial Registration}
\noindent
We compute the centre of mass, the principal components and the convex hull of the set of all 3D cell positions at the last time point. Our aim is that the convex hulls of different datasets should match optimally. Using this information each dataset is then initially translated to the origin (black node in Figure~\ref{fig:spatialRegistration}, top) according to the centre of mass and rotated by its associated principal components (arrows in Figure~\ref{fig:spatialRegistration}, top). Through this, we have created a common Cartesian coordinate system resulting in three orthogonal views: \textit{Front} (x-y, growth towards the observer), \textit{side} (x-z, along shoot/root axis), and \textit{radial} view (y-z, transversal cut perpendicular to shoot/root axis). Refinements are done manually by slight affine transformations in such a way that the datasets fit to the base of the VLR with respect to the convex hulls (see Figure~\ref{fig:spatialRegistration}, bottom). This fitting represents an optimal basis for comparing different lateral roots developing from almost the same base position. The visualisation of the 3D datasets is realized in \textit{Mathematica} in which cell nuclei are rendered as
colour-coded spheres according to their respective cell lineage (see Figure~\ref{fig:trackingfounders}).

}
	\label{fig:spatialRegistration}
	\end{center}
\end{figure}
%

\subsubsection{Temporal Registration}
\noindent
The lapse of time between gravistimulation and the onset of imaging differs between the recorded datasets. Therefore, we compensated for the temporal difference between the recordings by carrying out two kinds of synchronization. For temporal synchronization of the datasets, we added the time span between gravistimulation and the onset of imaging. A second approach was to synchronise on the total number of cells which gives a developmental synchronization and allows to directly compare the datasets. For this purpose, the intersection set of the number of cells among all datasets for the first and last time points are observed. Thus, the number of cells are in the range of $[10,176]$ for \#120830, $[15,160]$ for \#121204, $[18,260]$ for \#121211, $[9,143]$ for \#130508 and $[15,267]$ for \#130607. Consequently, the intersection range is $[18, 143]$ and datasets are analysed for identical numbers of cells.

\section{Quantitative Analysis of the VLR Datasets}
\subsection{Growth Rate}
To estimate cellular growth rate and doubling time of each VLR, we performed a data fitting on the total number of cells for all datasets assuming an exponential growth model (see Figure~\ref{fig:growthcurves}):
\begin{equation}
N(t)=N_0e^{kt},
\end{equation}
where $N(t)$ is the number of cells at time point $t$, $N_0$ the number of cells at $t=0$ and $k$ the growth rate. This rate was determined by a \textit{Least Squares Fitting} using \textit{MATLAB} (\href{http://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/}{http://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/}) while the doubling time $T$ is computed as $T=\frac{ln(2)}{k}$.

%\subsection{Geometric Measurements}
%We computed the height, width, length and volume of the VLR using \textit{Mathematica}:
%\begin{Itemize}
% \item The height is defined as the distance between the lateral root primordium tip and the surface of the pericycle. In the VLR, the height can be expressed as the difference between the maximum and the minimum positions of the cells located in the master cell file and given in radial view.
% \item The width is determined as the maximum distance between any two cell nuclei in radial view at 50\% of the height. \TODO{why 50\% ? why not taking the maximum distance between any two cells?}
% \item The length is computed as the maximum distance between any two cell nuclei in side view at 50\% of the height. \TODO{why 50\% ? why not taking the maximum distance between any two cells?}
% \item The volume is given by the 3D convex hull encompassing all cells of the VLR.
%\end{Itemize} 

\subsection{Cell Division Properties}
\noindent
For all datasets we capture relevant properties for daughter cells of a division event:

\noindent
\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{@{} >{\RaggedRight}p{6.8cm} X @{}}
\textbf{Time point} &

\textbf{Angle between two consecutive divisions}&

\end{tabularx}

}
	\label{fig:divisionAngles}
	\end{center}
\end{figure}
%

\noindent
We performed statistical analyses and plottings of the interphase duration (Figure 3C, main text and Figure~\ref{fig:mastertimediv}) and of the angle between two consecutive divisions (Figure 4C-D, I and Figure 5C, F, I, L, O in main text using \textit{R} (\href{http://www.R-project.org/}{http://www.R-project.org/}).

\section{Automatic Classification of Cell Divisions in the VLR}
\label{sec:divisionTypes}
\noindent
We developed an automatic algorithm~\cite[chapter 4]{FangerauDiss_2015} to classify the three different division types occurring during growth in the lateral root based on the orientation of the cell division axis: \textcolor{red}{\textbf{anticlinal}} divisions are parallel to the root-shoot axis, \textcolor{green}{\textbf{periclinal}} divisions are normal to the surface of the main root and \textcolor{blue}{\textbf{radial}} divisions are tangential to the surface of the main root and orthogonal to the root-shoot axis (see Figure~\ref{fig:divisionTypes}).
%
\begin{figure}[htbp]
	\begin{center}
		\begin{overpic}[width=0.8\linewidth]{images/divisionTypes.pdf}
		\end{overpic}
\caption[]
{
{\bf Division types in the lateral root.}
}
	\label{fig:divisionTypes}
	\end{center}
\end{figure}
%
3D surfaces are constructed using the set of cell positions for each time point. These surfaces are used to generate vertex and surface normal vectors that are compared with the division directions of all cells dividing at that time point. More precisely, the angle between the normal and the direction vector for each division is measured. Through this, each cell division can be classified as either anticlinal, periclinal or radial. The surfaces are generated using $\alpha$-shapes which are a good approximation of the evolving dome-shaped lateral root (see Figure~\ref{fig:alphaShapes}, bottom).
%
\begin{figure}[htbp]
	\begin{center}
		\begin{overpic}[width=1.\linewidth]{images/alphaShapes_compressed.pdf}
		\end{overpic}
\caption[]
{
{\bf Visualisation and approximation of VLR. Top:} Nuclei of last time point for dataset $\# 130607$ in front, side and radial view. {\bf Bottom:} Approximation of the lateral root using $\alpha$-shapes.
}
	\label{fig:alphaShapes}
	\end{center}
\end{figure}
%
However, when using a single surface to represent the whole VLR we can only derive normal vectors for the cells on the surface. This means that for cells dividing in the interior of the lateral root, no suitable normal vectors can be retrieved to classify the division orientations. For this reason, after a division classified as periclinal, the ``outer'' daughter cell is assigned to a new $\alpha$-shape with a new colouring (see Figure~\ref{fig:newSurfaceGeneration}). By generating new surfaces with this approach we are able to obtain normal vectors even for cells dividing in the interior. The algorithm is capable of classifying most of the cell divisions correctly. We manually verified the classification and corrected it whenever necessary. The cell division type for each cell nucleus is added to the VLR datasets. The method is implemented in a visualisation software called \textit{scifer} (\href{http://www.iwr.uni-heidelberg.de/groups/CoVis/software.php}{http://www.iwr.uni-heidelberg.de/groups/CoVis/software.php}). For a more detailed description of the algorithm and a performance analysis we refer the reader to the thesis of Fangerau~\cite[chapter 4]{FangerauDiss_2015}.

\section{Quantification and Visualisation of Lateral Root Deformation}
\noindent
The VLR datasets served as a basis to perform an analysis of the lateral root deformation as a function of time. The analysis was inspired by the work of Graner~et~al.~\cite{graner_et_al_2008}. The idea is that the deformation can be computed using geometrical and topological properties of the underlying tissue. Since in our case we have a set of 3D cell nuclei for each time point (red nodes in Figure~\ref{fig:deformation}) we use their 3D positions to generate a triangulation (e.g. Delaunay triangulation) creating a surface that represents the tissue (see Figure~\ref{fig:deformation}). The deformation analysis can be performed object- or spatial-oriented. This means that either the deformation is evaluated and illustrated for each cell or the total area of interest is subdivided into regions of equal sizes to measure the deformation within each subregion. We consider the former case because we want to focus on individual cell changes. Besides, the initial number of cells in each dataset is quite small and therefore, the total area of interest is not covered by all cells which makes an object-oriented analysis per cell more reasonable.

\end{figure}
%

\subsection{Computation of Geometrical and Topological Contributions}
\noindent
The generated triangulation provides a neighbourhood information for each cell nucleus and we can further analyse the deformation of a cell over time. Let $c_1$ be one cell with position $p_{c_1} = ( x_1, y_1, z_1 )^T$. Another cell $c_2$ with position $p_{c_2} = ( x_2, y_2, z_2 )^T$ is a neighbour of $c_1$ if both share an edge or link $l = p_{c_2} - p_{c_1}$. Note that $l$ and $-l$ represent the same role of deformation but to be invariant under the change $l \rightarrow -l$, a \textit{link matrix} $m$ is used~\cite{graner_et_al_2008}:
\begin{equation}
m = l \otimes l =
\begin{pmatrix}
X^2 & XY & XZ\\
YX & Y^2 & YZ\\
ZX & ZY & Z^2
\end{pmatrix}
, \qquad
\left( X, Y, Z \right) = \left( x_2 - x_1, y_2 - y_1, z_2 - z_1 \right).
\end{equation}
This matrix incorporates the square link length and the angle by computing the tensor product of the link $l$. Further computations consider the average of all relevant links $N$ for a specific cell which is defined as the \textit{texture tensor}~\cite{aubouy_et_al_2003}:
\begin{equation}
M = \langle m \rangle = \langle l \otimes l \rangle = 
\begin{pmatrix}
\langle X^2 \rangle & \langle XY \rangle& \langle XZ \rangle\\
\langle YX \rangle & \langle Y^2 \rangle & \langle YZ \rangle\\
\langle ZX \rangle & \langle ZY \rangle & \langle Z^2 \rangle
\end{pmatrix}
= \mathlarger{\mathlarger{\nicefrac{\sum\limits_{N} l \otimes l}{N}}}.
\end{equation}

\noindent
The geometrical and topological terms are now computed by considering the variation of conserved, appearing and disappearing links between two time points $t$ and $t + \Delta t$ (see Figure~\ref{fig:ellipseDeformation}, left). More precisely, the geometrical variation, denoted as $B$ is computed by averaging the amount of conserved links $N_c$ between two time points~\cite{graner_et_al_2008}:
\begin{equation}
B = \frac{N_c}{N} \left\langle \frac{\Delta m}{\Delta t} \right\rangle = \frac{N_c}{N} \left\langle \frac{\Delta (l \otimes l) }{\Delta t} \right\rangle.
\end{equation}
This means that $M$ is evaluated at $t$ and $t + \Delta t$ and the difference is computed. For small $\Delta t$ values, $\frac{N_c}{N} \rightarrow 1$ because then almost all links $N$ are conserved and $B$ can then be written as:
\begin{equation}
B = \left\langle l \otimes \frac{dl}{dt} \right\rangle + \left\langle \frac{dl}{dt} \otimes l \right\rangle.
\end{equation}
The topological variation $T$ takes the averaging of the $N_a$ appeared and $N_d$ disappeared links into account depending on the corresponding averaged textures $\langle m_a \rangle$ and $\langle m_d \rangle$~\cite{graner_et_al_2008}:
\begin{equation}
T = \frac{1}{\Delta t} \left( \frac{\Delta N_a}{N} \langle m_a \rangle - \frac{\Delta N_d}{N} \langle m_d \rangle \right).
\end{equation}
The total deformation for each cell is then given by $B+T$. This sum is a matrix for which the eigenvalues $\lambda_i$ are computed. The magnitudes of these eigenvalues are proportional to the axes lengths of an ellipsoid that represents the spatial 3D deformation of a cell between $t$ and $t + \Delta t$ (see Figure~\ref{fig:ellipseDeformation}, right for a 2D case). We compute the $B$ and $T$ terms for all 3D cell positions but we focus the visualisation on the 2D views using the side, front and radial views. Because of these 2D projections we illustrate the deformations by ellipses instead of ellipsoids in 3D for a more reasonable analysis. Figure~\ref{fig:ellipseResults} shows the resulting ellipses indicating the largest deformation (longest semi-axis) of two datasets right before the last time point.

\subsection{Averaging over Datasets}
\noindent
The above evaluation allows us to analyse the deformation of individual cells between two time points $t$ and $t + \Delta t$. Our intention is to analyse the averaged deformation of the VLR with respect to all five datasets. Note that we performed a spatial and a temporal registration of all datasets as described in Section~\ref{sec:registration}. The intersection range for the number of cells is $[18, 143]$. With this, the time point size $\Delta t$ is actually the variation of number of cells depending on the total number of considered steps $S$:
\begin{equation}
\Delta t = \frac{143 - 18}{S},
\end{equation}
and the current number of cell $s(i)$ for each step $i$ is:
\begin{equation}
s(i) = \left\lfloor s_i + 0.5 \right\rfloor, \qquad s_i = s_{i-1} + \Delta t, \qquad s_0 = 18.
\end{equation}
The usage of the floor function rounds $s(i)$ to the nearest integer value because $\Delta t$ might be a float value. However, it cannot be guaranteed that $s(i)$ appears in each dataset because of several cell divisions at one time point. We solve this issue by determining the nearest smallest possible cell number with respect to the current $s(i)$.


For each number of cell pair $s(i)$ and $s(i+1)$, $B+T$ is evaluated for each dataset resulting in the corresponding deformation information. To average it over all datasets we create a grid of tiles with constant but arbitrary dimension (see Figure~\ref{fig:gridDeformation}, left). For each tile in the grid we compute the average deformation of all ellipses whose centres are located in the corresponding tile. More precisely, the deformation in 3D given by all three axes of the ellipsoid is first averaged for each cell. Let $d_1, d_2, d_3$ be the three deformation vectors and $m_1, m_2, m_3$ the corresponding magnitudes. The average deformation $d_a$ and average magnitude $m_a$ per cell is then given by the mean:
\begin{equation}
d_a = \frac{1}{3} \sum_{i=1}^{3} d_i, \qquad m_a = \frac{1}{3} \sum_{i=1}^{3} m_i.
\end{equation}
Afterwards, the deformation vectors $d_a$ and the corresponding magnitudes $m_a$ of all $n$ cells located in the same tile are averaged:
\begin{equation}
D_a = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{n} d_a, \qquad M_a = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{n} m_a.
\end{equation}
As a result, each tile shows an averaged deformation represented by a line with normalized length. The averaged magnitudes are illustrated by a colour map and additional ``bow ties'' illustrate the variance of the deformation orientation (see Figure~\ref{fig:gridDeformation}, right).

We perform this averaging for all three views (front, side, radial). Figure 2B in the main text shows the deformation result for the first, mid and last time point ranges. For the front and radial view, we illustrate the deformation for all cells while for the side view we focus only on the cell changes located in the master cell file. Note that we determine in all cases the deformation information based on all 3D+t cell data. Table~\ref{tab:deformationParameters} lists the minimum and maximum magnitudes for the deformations in the different views. We have chosen $S=20$ steps for which $\Delta t = 6.25$ with an average increase rate of $12.06$ cells per step. The exact numbers of cells for each step in the supplemental movie (see Section~\ref{sec:suppmovies}) are given in Table~\ref{tab:growthTensor}. The deformation computation as well as the visualisation are realized in \textit{MATLAB}.

\section{Modelling of a Lateral Root Formation}
\noindent
We use a non-mechanical 2D vertex-based model for lateral root development. The evolving 2D tissue of the model is described by a graph, i.e.~an abstract structure in which a set of vertices is connected by a set of edges. In this context, an edge denotes a cell wall and a vertex corresponds to a junction that forms the point of contact between at least two cell walls~\cite{prusinkiewicz_lindenmayer_1990, prusinkiewicz_runions_2012}. As a consequence, the complete topology of all cells in the model (such as neighbourhood information) can be accessed via a graph rotation system~\cite{edmonds_1960}. We realize the implementation of the 2D model using \textit{OpenGL} (\href{https://www.opengl.org/}{https://www.opengl.org/}) and the \textit{VV} (Vertex-Vertex) programming language~\cite{smith_et_al_2004, smith_2006} which is embedded in a C{}\verb!++! programming environment.

%L-systems or also called Lindenmayer~Systems~\cite{lindenmayer_1968, prusinkiewicz_lindenmayer_1990}. The L-system is a language that consists of a set of strings based on predefined rules. More precisely, it consists of an axiom, the starting point of the system, and a set of production rules. The growth of a dynamic structure is realized by applying these rules to the axiom in which the resulting string is again in the language of the used system. Through this, the growth can be described by an infinite set of strings that 'steers' the growth behaviour. L-systems are commonly used to model plant growths as well as to generate fractals such as the Sierpinski triangle, for example.

We use a 2D model for two main reasons. First, we focus our analysis on the cells located in the master cell file of the VLR. These cells contribute most to the growth of the VLR and feature the property that they are mostly located within a plane in 3D. Thus, their 3D locations can be projected onto a 2D plane in side view without (too much) loss of information. Second, such a model is much easier to describe than a 3D model which significantly reduces the complexity and therefore simplifies the analysis. Our intention is the creation of an idealised model based on simple rules that allows a comparison to the VLR datasets.

\noindent
Our model requires the application of a underlying \textbf{model surface} that represents the developing lateral root. Furthermore, the positioning and the number of \textbf{founder cells} that contribute to the development have to be determined. Additionally, the \textbf{rules for cell division events} have to be defined, i.e.~the type and time point of a division event. In a nutshell, the simulation starts with a predefined number and positioning of founder cells and develops over time based on the underlying surface structure. During the simulation, the model surface and the cells within grow and increase in area. According to the chosen division properties, a cell divides if it exceeds a specific area threshold or area ratio with respect to its initial size right after its birth. Through this, we generate a convenient model representing the growth of the lateral root.

In the next sections, we will describe the underlying model surface and the settings for the initial founder cells and divisions. Afterwards, we explain the different model scenarios addressed in the main text.

\subsection{Model Surface}
\noindent
The choice of the underlying surface for the model fundamentally affects the development of the tissue. This means that a change of vertex positions on the surface influences the walls and junctions of all cells in the model. In our case, we use \textit{B\'ezier surfaces} to create an idealised model that allows the investigation of a common growth behaviour of the lateral root.
%The first one is used to create a triangulation based on real nuclei positions in the dataset for each time point. Through this, we can generate a data-driven model that incorporates the deformation behaviour of the nuclei and are able to compare the result with the real-world datasets.
%\subsubsection{Triangle Mesh}
%\noindent
%For each real-world dataset, we create a set of 2D triangle meshes. This means that for each time point, we generate a triangulation based on the corresponding real nuclei positions located in the master cell file only because these are mainly responsible for the overall dome-like structure of the VLR. Through this, the triangulation captures the temporal displacement and growth behaviour of the nuclei which is then further used in the model to dictate the simulation and tissue growth (see Figure~\ref{fig:surfaceGeneration}). More precisely, the cells in the model consists of changing junctions that are affected by the triangle changes. If a junction $j$ of a cell is located within a specific triangle then $j$ is given uniquely by a convex combination $j = \lambda_1 r_1 + \lambda_2 r_2 + \lambda_3 r_3$ of the three triangle vertices $r_i$. The $\lambda_i$ $\left( \sum_{i=1}^{3} \lambda_i = 1, \lambda_i \geq 0 \; \forall i \right)$ are called the barycentric coordinates of $j$ with respect to the triangle. In the model itself, a lot of conversions between these barycentric and Cartesian coordinates occur to compute the changing cells.

%
%The triangulation can be either realized by a Delaunay triangulation or an $\alpha$-shape. Since we are only using the nuclei to construct the triangulation we require some additional information to of the VLR contour. Therefore, for each dataset, we manually generate a set of contour points to approximate the boundary of the VLR for the first (bottom left image in Figure~\ref{fig:surfaceGeneration}) and the last (bottom right image in Figure~\ref{fig:surfaceGeneration}) time point. We choose a constant number of 16 points such that the contour points for the time points in between are interpolated linearly (see bottom mid image in Figure~\ref{fig:surfaceGeneration}).

%	\label{fig:surfaceMapping}
%	\end{center}
%\end{figure}
%%
%
%For the set of generated meshes, a bijective mapping of the triangles between time point $t$ and $t+1$ is required for the computation of arbitrary cell positions in between in the model. This means that each nuclei position in time point $t+1$ is uniquely assigned to a previous position in time point $t$ (top left in Figure~\ref{fig:surfaceMapping}). More precisely, our approach requires that we use the same triangulation (but with different nuclei positions) for subsequent time points. However, cell divisions may result in more nuclei in the next time point and consequently in more triangles (top right in Figure~\ref{fig:surfaceMapping}) impairing the bijectivity. To overcome this issue, for each occurring cell division, the average position of the two daughter cells (grey nodes) is computed at the next time point and represents a single nuclei position (cyan node) that can be bijectively mapped to the previous dividing cell (green node). At time point $t+2$, the two triangles originally created at $t+1$ are considered and the next time point $t+3$ is checked again. In total, there are two triangle meshes for each pair of subsequent time points that guarantee a bijective mapping which are between time point $t$ and $t+1$, as well as $t+2$ and $t+3$, respectively.
%
%The exchange of the different triangle meshes between $t+1$ and $t+2$ is realized by another approach. Consider the simplified model with three cells in Figure~\ref{fig:triangleExchange} and the inner junction $j$ in the model. At time point $t$, the position of $j$ is computed by its barycentric coordinates within the blue-rimmed triangle. When in the next time point the triangle mesh should have changed then it will be checked in which triangle $j$ is located now. Based on the position in the newly found blue-rimmed triangle, the new barycentric coordinates are computed. In further steps, either only a bijective mapping between two equal triangulations is needed or the same approach is applied facing a new triangle mesh. Note that at the beginning of the model, the setting of cells as well as their positions have to be defined manually. Based on these positions, the triangles are identified in which the junctions are located and the barycentric coordinates are computed.

A two-dimensional B\'ezier surface of degree $(n, m)$ with $(n+1) \cdot (m+1)$ control points $c_{i, j} \in \mathbb{R}^2$ is a parametric surface that maps the unit square into a smooth-continuous surface embedded in the same space as its control points. Each point $P(u, v) \in \mathbb{R}^2$ on such a B\'ezier surface $S_{cur}$ with parametric coordinates $u ,v \in [0,1]$ is computed by the following equation:
\begin{equation}
P(u, v) = \sum_{i=0}^{n} \sum_{j=0}^{m} B_{i}^{n} (u) \; B_{j}^{m} (v) \; c_{i,j}, \qquad B_{i}^{n} (u) = \binom{n}{i} u^i (1-u)^{n-i}.
\end{equation}
As a consequence, given only a pair of B\'ezier surfaces $S_{first}$ and $S_{last}$ to describe the first and the last time point of the model, the surface at each other time point in between is computed by a linear interpolation of the control points $a_{i,j} \in S_{first}$ and $b_{i,j} \in S_{last}$:
\begin{equation}
c_{i,j} = (1-t) \cdot a_{i,j} + t \cdot b_{i,j}, \qquad \forall i, j \in [0, n], [0, m],
\end{equation}
with the control points $c_{i,j}$ of the current B\'ezier surface $S_{cur}$ and $t \in [0,1]$ as the temporal interpolation factor. By this, only two B\'ezier surfaces need to be generated manually for the model while the B\'ezier surfaces in between are given by interpolation which ensures a smooth growth behaviour of the VLR. Another advantage of using this kind of surface is that the mapping of each pair of parametric coordinates $u_i, v_i$ to a 2D position on the surface is unique although of course the developing surface structure will change over time (see Figure~\ref{fig:modelSurface}).

\subsection{Configuration of Founder Cells}
\label{sec:founderCells}
\noindent
For the model we have to set the number and spatial properties of founder cells of the lateral root.
%\subsubsection{Data-driven Models}
%\noindent
%The first setting is designed in such a way that a valid comparison between model and real world dataset is achieved. The underlying surface of the model is a triangle mesh based on real nuclei positions as explained above. Furthermore, the number of cells in the model is selected such that it approximately matches the same number of cells in the real-world datasets for both, the beginning and the end of the given datasets. In order to preserve the same number of cells at the end in the model, we steer the parameter for the division event as explained later.
We consider two different model configurations at the beginning. In the first one, the model starts with two founder cells of equal sizes and shapes (see Figure~\ref{fig:founderCellsSetting}, left) which develops depending on the selected division rules explained in Section~\ref{sec:divisionRules}. The second configuration is identical to the first one but we force the first division to be an asymmetric anticlinal one (see Figure~\ref{fig:founderCellsSetting}, right). More precisely, the inner daughter cells share the same size but with only one third of the parents cell sizes.
%\begin{inparaenum}[(\itshape i\upshape)]
%\item The model with two founder cells of equal sizes (see Figure~\ref{fig:founderCellsSetting}, top left) develops depending on the selected division rules explained below.
%\item The start configuration is identical to (\textit{i}) but we force the first division to be asymmetric (see  Figure~\ref{fig:founderCellsSetting}, top right). More precisely, the inner daughter cells share the same size but with only one third of the parents cell sizes.
%\item Identical to (\textit{ii}) but we force the second division to be a symmetric periclinal one (see Figure~\ref{fig:founderCellsSetting}, bottom left).
%\item Identical to (\textit{ii}) but we force the second division to be a symmetric anticlinal one (see Figure~\ref{fig:founderCellsSetting}, bottom right).
%\end{inparaenum}
%Note that for the first and second division rounds the VLR model already started to evolve and eventually changed its tissue structure. For the sake of clarity, Figure~\ref{fig:founderCellsSetting} only covers the division scenarios without any evolution of the tissue.

%

\subsection{Division Events}
\noindent
In the model, time point and axis orientation of each division have to be determined. We use non-deterministic division rules for each model, i.e.\ a random variation of orientation of the division axis. By repeated simulations (e.g.\ 100) of such a probabilistic model with the same setting we can analyse its division behaviour based on statistically solid results.

\subsubsection{Time Point of Division}
\noindent
At each time point of the model simulation, the area of each cell is computed and compared with its initial area. If the cell's area exceeds the initial area by a certain amount a division event will occur. This amount is determined by setting an \textit{area ratio} and an \textit{area threshold}. The ratio defines the maximal percentage increase of a cell before it should divide. For example, a ratio of $0.5$ denotes that the cell will divide if its initial size has increased by at least $50\%$. However, only using this ratio would result in cell areas that converge to zero in later steps because the percentage ratio above would result in smaller cells over time. For this reason, the area threshold is used as a barrier to guarantee a minimum area for each cell before it divides.

\subsubsection{Orientation of Division Axis}
\label{sec:divisionRules}
\noindent
After defining the time point of a division event we need to set the orientation of the division axis. In our model, we consider two division rules which we refer to as Besson-Dumais rule and random rule.
%\begin{Itemize}
%\item Besson-Dumais (BD),
%\item Alternating plane of division (D) + random variation,
%\item Perpendicular to principal direction of growth (PDG) + random variation,
%\item Random (R) and,
%\item Random with equal daughter cell sizes (RE).
%\end{Itemize}

\caption[]
{
{\bf  Besson-Dumais division rule.}
}
	\label{fig:divisionRules}
	\end{center}
\end{figure}
%

The Besson-Dumais division rule~\cite{besson_and_dumais_2011} can be seen as a generalization of the shortest wall or Errera's rule~\cite{errera_1886} which will always result in the shortest division axis that can be generated to connect two opposing cell walls through the centre of mass (red dots in Figure~\ref{fig:divisionRules}). Using this rule, each axis orientation of a set of $N$ possible orientations is assigned a specific probability value based on the length $l_i$ of the line and the cell's area $A$:
\begin{equation}
p_i = \frac{e^{-\beta l_i / \rho}}{\sum_{j=1}^{N} e^{-\beta l_j / \rho}}.
\end{equation}
$\rho = \sqrt{A}$ is the mean cell diameter and $\beta = 20.6$ is a parameter that was empirically determined by Besson and Dumais~\cite{besson_and_dumais_2011} for which the proportion of cells dividing along the shortest wall is supported by this value. As a consequence, we have a probability distribution function for the set of division axes and the axis with the highest probability is identical with the shortest one. Figure~\ref{fig:divisionRules} illustrates three examples of division orientations and their corresponding colour-coded probabilities.

%The next scenario is in choosing a division axis that is perpendicular to the principal direction of the cell's growth \textbf{(PDG)}. More precisely, a set of changing centre of mass positions for each cell since its birth and right before it divides is gathered. For this set, the principal component is computed and the next division axis is then perpendicular to this principal direction. However, the whole division behaviour is deterministic and we therefore include a randomized variation of the division orientations by defining a random angle range $[-\alpha, \alpha]$. After determining the division axis, its orientation is varied by a randomly chosen angle value within this range (see Figure~\ref{fig:divisionRules}, PDG). The model result with $\alpha = 10$ is given in Figure~\ref{fig:suppmodel}G-I.

%The alternating plane of division rule \textbf{(D)} will result in a division axis that is always perpendicular to the previous division axis of the parent cell. The initial division orientation is given by the setting of the founder cells. Thus, equal to PDG, using this rule result in a deterministic division behaviour which is always the same for each repeated model simulation. Consequently, we add a randomized variation of the division orientation (see Figure~\ref{fig:divisionRules}, D). Note that the interphase duration between these two division events take some time in which the cell's size is increasing. However, in Figure~\ref{fig:divisionRules}, D, the cell has the same size and shape in the next division round for the sake of clarity. The model result with $\alpha = 10$ is given in Figure~\ref{fig:suppmodel}J-L.

In contrast, the random rule generates arbitrary division axis orientations through the centre of mass with respect to a cell-shape preserving property that is explained in Section~\ref{sec:cellShape}. All possible division orientations have the same probability.

%We also considered a division rule that is identical to R but which preserves almost equal areas of the daughter cells \textbf{(RE)}. Note that when using only straight lines as division walls a perfect splitting of a cell into two equal areas is not always satisfied. As a consequence, it cannot be guaranteed that the division axis is in a right angle to both connected cell walls. But for simplification in the model analysis we stick to a straight division axis and not to a curved one. If a division orientation is chosen randomly, the two resulting daughter cell areas $A_1, A_2$ are computed with respect to their parent cell's size $A$ and the percentage values $p_1, p_2$ are compared with each other:
%\begin{equation}
%p_1 = \nicefrac{A_1}{A}, \qquad p_2 = \nicefrac{A_2}{A}.
%\end{equation}
%If $| p_1 - p_2 | > \eta$ with $\eta$ a user-chosen threshold then a new division orientation is randomly chosen until this inequality is satisfied (with a maximum number of attempts $N$ to avoid infinity loops). A model result is given in Figure~\ref{fig:suppmodel}D-F with $\eta = 10$ and $N=50$.

\subsection{Model Scenarios}
\label{sec:modelScenarios}
\noindent
Using the B\'ezier surfaces, the setting of founder cells as well as the division properties, we are able to create a model of the lateral root. We research how the division behaviour is influenced when cells are dividing based on a specific rule or randomly. Furthermore, we investigate the robustness of the model when changing certain properties. In total, we consider four different model scenarios:

\noindent
\textbf{Model 1: Geometric}\\
\noindent
In Model 1, we choose the first configuration with two founder cells that have equal areas and shapes. The division axes are chosen based on the Besson-Dumais division rule described in Section~\ref{sec:divisionRules} (see Figure 5D-F in main text).

\noindent
\textbf{Model 2: Random}\\
\noindent
For Model 2, the initial founder cell configuration is identical to Model 1 but the orientation of the division axis is chosen randomly for all divisions (see Figure 5G-I in main text).

\noindent
\textbf{Model 3: 1\textsuperscript{st} random then geometric}\\
\noindent
In Model 3, the initial cell configuration is identical to Model 1 but we randomise the orientation of the division axes in the first division round and use the Besson-Dumais division rule for all subsequent divisions (see Figure 5J-L in main text). By this, we can analyse the robustness of the model development with respect to the first division round.

\noindent
\textbf{Model 4: Basal growth}\\
\noindent
Model 4 is designed to check whether the lateral root growth itself is responsible for the emergence of the observed sequence of periclinal divisions. For this purpose, we change the deformation behaviour of the B\'ezier surface from an equidistant distribution of control points to a distribution in which the control points are growing faster towards the dome tip (see Figure~\ref{fig:basalGrowth}). We force the first division round to be an asymmetric anticlinal one and we use the Besson-Dumais rule for subsequent divisions. As a result, the model leads to more dominant cell divisions at the base of the VLR. This model impairs the high-order pattern of periclinal divisions (see Figure 5M-O in main text) although the layer formation and division orientations are similar to the model results using an equidistant distribution of control points. \TODO{@Alexis: in the main text we are using 1DC for the basal growth; should we maybe only use NH? Then all models share the same cell founder setting.}

\subsubsection{Model Simulation}
\noindent
For each model scenario, we perform $100$ simulations with $500$ model steps (time points) to test how stable the model and therefore the division results are based on the randomised variations of the division rules. Furthermore, we use a constant area threshold value of $1100$ while the area ratio is chosen in such a way that at the end approximately $64$ cells are generated. This value originates from the average number of cells in the master cell file for all five wild type datasets ($(64+49+81+46+82)/5 \approx 64$). Table~\ref{tab:modelParameters} lists all area ratios, average numbers of cells, anticlinal and periclinal divisions for each model scenario.

\subsection{Model Modifications}
We apply some modifications to the model that affect the resulting tissue and cells in order to better approximate a real-world behaviour.
\subsubsection{Cell Shape Preservation}
\label{sec:cellShape}
\noindent
In the model, a total random configuration of cell division axes may result in implausible cell developments with unequal sizes and triangle-shaped contours that cannot be observed in any real-world scenario of plant growth. We want to analyse a random behaviour of cell divisions that somehow preserve equal sizes and shapes of cells after divisions. We therefore first find a set of division axis orientations that satisfy a specific constraint and assign each one the same probability value. The idea of this approach is explained in Figure~\ref{fig:shapePreserving}. We use a value of $\delta = 0.15$ for the random division rule while this approach is not applied to the Besson-Dumais rule because there we do not observe any implausible cell shapes.
%

{
{\bf Cell Shape Preservation.} For each division axis through the centre of mass rotated by an user-selected angle $\alpha$, a length check of the connected cell walls is applied. For this purpose, the two interconnecting nodes $u$ and $v$ as well as the adjacent junctions $u_1, u_2$ and $v_1, v_2$ are determined. From these positions the lengths $a, b, c, d$ and the cell wall lengths $a+b$ and $c+d$ are computed. It is then checked which of the four cases $a < (a+b)\cdot \delta$, $b < (a+b)\cdot \delta$, $c < (c+d)\cdot \delta$, or $d < (c+d)\cdot \delta$ is true. If only one statement is false then this division axis orientation is omitted. The user-selected value $\delta$ is in the range $[0,1]$ and denotes the percentage that a sub-line must have with respect to the total cell wall length.
}
	\label{fig:shapePreserving}
	\end{center}
\end{figure}
%

\subsubsection{Computation of Centre of Mass}
\noindent
Note that for all division rules the division axis always passes through the centre of mass. However, in later model steps, more and more cells are created that share several junctions (see Figure~\ref{fig:levelOfDetail}, left).
%
\begin{figure}[htbp]
	\begin{center}
		\begin{overpic}[width=1.\linewidth]{images/levelOfDetail.pdf}
		\end{overpic}
\caption[]
{
{\bf Modified computation of centre of mass. Left:} The centre of mass of cells with several junctions may not yield a ``real'' centre of the cell. \textbf{Right:} Using a level of detail approach yields few junctions preserving the shape of the cell.
}
	\label{fig:levelOfDetail}
	\end{center}
\end{figure}
%
Consequently, a cell consists of more junctions and the computed centre of mass will be located near the mass of junctions (cyan node in Figure~\ref{fig:levelOfDetail}, left). This may result in an implausible division axis that also does not preserve equal areas of daughter cells. In order to solve this issue, we perform a \textit{level of detail} of cell walls using the \textit{edge criterion}~\cite{jenks_1989} in such a way that only these junctions are preserved that mainly capture the shape of the cell. For example, the cell in Figure~\ref{fig:levelOfDetail} has seven junctions. Performing a level of detail results in a simplified cell shape that only has four remaining junctions (see Figure~\ref{fig:levelOfDetail}, right) while preserving the overall shape of the cell. The centre of mass is then computed based on these remaining junctions. A detailed description of the algorithm can be found in \cite[p.\ 59--60]{FangerauDiss_2015}. Note that we apply this level of detail only for the computation of the centre of mass. We do not remove any junctions of cells in the model itself.

\subsubsection{Smoothness of Model Surface}
\noindent
One initial cell consists of four junctions defining a rectangular cell shape within the underlying tissue.
%
\begin{figure}[htbp]
	\begin{center}
		\begin{overpic}[width=1.\linewidth]{images/subdivision.pdf}
		\end{overpic}
\caption[]
{
{\bf Subdivision approach for tissue modelling. Top:} Using only six junctions (red nodes) for two cells result in an implausible tissue model based on the underlying B\'ezier surface. \textbf{Bottom:} Creating more inner junctions (cyan nodes) result in a much smoother tissue development.
}
	\label{fig:subdivision}
	\end{center}
\end{figure}
%
For example, consider the first B\'ezier surface with two cells at the first model step resulting in six junctions (two are shared by the cells) with their corresponding parametric coordinates (see Figure~\ref{fig:subdivision}, top left). In a later model step, the tissue will start to grow evolving into the dome-like structure (see Figure~\ref{fig:subdivision}, top right). However, only the junction with the parametric coordinate $(u=\nicefrac{1}{2}, v=1)$ will move upwards based on the underlying B\'ezier surface creating a triangle-shaped tissue. In order to better embed the underlying surface into the model, additional inner junctions (cyan nodes in Figure~\ref{fig:subdivision}, bottom left) are created that result in a much smoother surface of the model (see Figure~\ref{fig:subdivision}, bottom right). This smoothness is defined by a user-chosen subdivision level which is $4$ in all our models and yields $2^{4-1} - 1 = 7$ additional inner junctions.

%\subsection{Visual Analysis}
%\subsubsection{Visualisation of the Model}
%\noindent
%We realize the implementation of the 2D model using \textit{OpenGL} (\href{https://www.opengl.org/}{https://www.opengl.org/}) and the \textit{VV} (Vertex-Vertex) programming language~\cite{smith_et_al_2004, smith_2006} which is embedded in a C{}\verb!++! programming environment. For a visual analysis, we generate three different representations of the evolving cells in the VLR: Illustration of
%\begin{inparaenum}[(\itshape i\upshape)]
%\item all cell contours (see Figure~\ref{fig:modelVisualisation}, left),
%\item cells as spheres (see Figure~\ref{fig:modelVisualisation}, mid) and
%\item adjacent cell layers (see Figure~\ref{fig:modelVisualisation}, right).
%\end{inparaenum}
%%
%\begin{figure}[htbp]

%		\begin{overpic}[width=1.\linewidth]{images/modelVisualisation.pdf}

%{
%{\bf Representation of evolving cells in model.} The model result can be illustrated by cell contours, cell spheres or by cell layers.
%}
%	\label{fig:modelVisualisation}
%	\end{center}
%\end{figure}
%%
%The first representation shows the cell contour information within the evolving tissue. Each cell is coloured by its corresponding layer value. The positions of the rendered spheres are given by the centres of mass of each cell. The third representation displays the cell layers between adjacent cells that share the same layer value. Cells are adjacent if they share at least one common cell wall. The lines (cylinders) are drawn for at least two cells through the centres of mass of the corresponding cells. Figure~\ref{fig:visumodel} shows the visualisations for the last model step of the four model scenarios.

\subsection{Visual Division Analysis}
\noindent
We run several simulations of one model using division rules with randomized variation, each resulting in one division sequence tree as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:treeDivisionSequencesCells}. Multiple simulation runs of each model allow us to use statistically solid model results and to compare them with the VLR datasets.
%
\begin{figure}[htbp]
	\begin{center}
		\begin{overpic}[width=0.4\linewidth]{images/averagedTreeDivisionSequence.pdf}
		\end{overpic}
\caption[]
{
{\bf Averaged division sequence tree.} In only $48 \%$ of the $100$ comparisons in total, the upper layers were generated before the lower ones resulting in a red rectangle. In the other two cases with fewer comparisons ($81$ and $92$), more than $74 \%$ of the upper layers were generated first and green rectangles are drawn.
}
	\label{fig:averagedTreeDivisionSequence}
	\end{center}
\end{figure}
%
For this purpose, we modify the visualisation of the division sequence trees. Let $l$ be the sequence length for a generated layer (e.g.\ $l=3$ for $012$). We replace the x-axis showing the time points by a fixed temporal layout of the tree in which the pair of upper concurrently generated layers (with identical number sequence except for the last number) always occur first (slight translation to the left) with respect to its lower layers with almost the same division sequence (except for the $(l-1)$-th number). For example, the pair of layers $0111/0112$ are combined because their sequences only differ in the last number. This pair is compared with the pair $0121/0122$ because they differ in the third ($l-1 = 4-1 = 3$) position of the sequence. For each such a comparison we render a rectangle that includes these two pairs of layers and its colour is set to red or green. The rectangle is green if in more than $50 \%$ of the model simulations the upper layer occurred first with respect to the lower one and else we colour it red. This allows an immediate visual feedback of the high-order pattern while detailed information about the percentage and number of possible comparisons are given in the mid of each rectangle (see Figure~\ref{fig:averagedTreeDivisionSequence}). A comparison between pair of layers is not possible if only one pair of layers is generated or none at all. We also use a simplified version of this tree as illustrated in Figure 5B,E,H,K,N.

(A) Perspective sketch of the plant specimen holder in front of the two objective lenses. Only the fluorophores in a thin planar volume that overlaps with the focal plane of the detection objective lens are excited. Thus, fluorophores outside this volume do not blur the image and are not subjected to photo bleaching. (B, E) The central components of the mDSLM are mounted on a plate. All optical components are inside a single aluminium block. Four motors below the specimen chamber move and rotate the plant. The filter wheel is uncoupled from the aluminium block. Images are captured with cameras from either Andor Clara or Andor Neo. A flexible optical glass fiber guides the light coming from a small fluorescent lamp above the plant in the microscope specimen chamber. (C) Top view of the specimen chamber. (D, F) Side-view into the chamber with the root in front of the detection lens. The plant grows in an upright position. While the leaves remain in the air, the root system is perfused with a liquid medium.

Labels on the left show the time points and top labels display the total number of divisions. The ``bricks'' visualisation at the bottom of each tree allows a comparison of division sequences between different trees. Each column represents the division sequence of a cell in the last segmented time point. The number of columns corresponds to the total number of cells at the last segmented time point, whereas the number of rows indicates the total number of division rounds (e.g. the leftmost leaf cell in the top left tree followed the division sequence anticlinal, periclinal, anticlinal, periclinal and anticlinal).

{{\bf Alternative visualisations of the model results.} For each model scenario (see Section~\ref{sec:modelScenarios}), the models at the end of the simulation are represented. Three types of visualisation are used: cell contours (top), nuclei (middle) and adjacent cell layers (bottom). Colours indicate the layers as illustrated in Figure 2D (main text). The positions of the rendered spheres are given by the centres of mass of each cell. The third representation displays the cell layers between adjacent cells that share the same layer value. Cells are adjacent if they share at least one common cell wall. The lines (cylinders) are drawn for at least two cells through the centres of mass of the corresponding cells.

%\caption[Models of lateral root formation with different rules of divisions.]
%{{\bf Models of lateral root formation with different rules of divisions.} In (A-C), the model is similar to Figure 5 (\emph{Model - Geometric}), except that the first division is forced to be asymmetric. In (D-F), a random choice of division plane is used (similar to Figure 5 (\emph{Model - Random}) but daughter cells have equal area sizes. In (G-I), the plane of division is perpendicular to the direction of growth (see Section~\ref{sec:divisionRules}), the first division of the founder is asymmetric. In (J-L), the plane of division is orthogonal to the previous one (see Section~\ref{sec:divisionRules}), the first division of the founder is asymmetric. (A, D, G, J) visualise the result of the models at the end of the simulation. Cell outlines (top), nuclei (middle) and layers (bottom) are represented. Colours indicate layers as in Figure 2D (main text). (B, E, H, K) tree representation of the order of periclinal divisions for 100 independent runs of the model. The dashed boxes indicate the proportion of models in which the periclinal divisions occur first in the outer layer (green $\geqslant$50\%, red $<$50\%). (C, F, I, L) Pie charts representing the proportion of alternated divisions (in blue) between the indicated division rounds. For reference, the proportions observed in the VLR (Figure 4D, main text) are indicated. \TODO{Maybe remove since not used models.}}

\noindent
In this section, we briefly explain the file formatting of the generated and analysed VLR files stored in the \textit{*.csv} format. In total, there are five wild type datasets (\#120830WT.csv, \#121204WT.csv, \#121211WT.csv, \#130508WT.csv, \#130607WT.csv) and the \emph{aurora} mutant (auroraMutant.csv). As already explained in section~\ref{sec:segmentation}, for each cell, we only store the position of the first and the last frame before it divides. In the program, the positions in between are interpolated linearly. All files share the same header information which are explained below:

\noindent
\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{@{} >{\RaggedRight}p{2.8cm} X @{}}
\textbf{DataRotation:} &
Angles for which the dataset is rotated around the x, y and z axes to create the three viewing types: Front (x-y), side (x-z) and radial (y-z).\\
\textbf{RootCenter:} &
Centre of the root which is determined manually.\\
\textbf{DataDimension:} &
Dimension of the raw dataset.\\
\textbf{Id:} &
The unique ID for each cell nucleus.\\
\textbf{X, Y, Z, T:} &
The 3D position and the time point of the cell.\\
\textbf{Precursors:} &
The sorted list of precursor IDs to generate the tracking information.\\
\textbf{Lineage:} &
The cell lineage identifier.\\
\textbf{CellFile:} &
The cell file value which is determined manually.\\
\textbf{Layer:} &
The unique layer value according to performed periclinal divisions.\\
\textbf{DivType:} &
The type of division of the cell: anticlinal $\widehat{=} \; 0$, periclinal $\widehat{=} \; 1$, radial $\widehat{=} \; 2$. For the first pair of a cell description and the last analysed time point, ``-'' is inserted.\\
