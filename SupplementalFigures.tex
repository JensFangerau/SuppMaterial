{\bf Time lapse recording of lateral root primordia development in five wild type datasets.}
{\bf A:} Lateral root induction by gravistimulation. Seven days old plants were rotated by 90$\degree$ for different time periods. The number of emerged lateral roots in the region of the bend were counted, three days later. In total, 94 plants from three independent experiments were analysed. {\bf B:} Arabidopsis plant after imaging in the monolithic Digital Scanned Laser Light Sheet-based Fluorescence Microscope (mDSLM). Arabidopsis plant in the mDSLM sample holder capillary inside of a petri dish seven weeks after the image acquisition. {\bf C:} For each dataset, the images show five time points of a longitudinal section (side view) and a transverse section (radial view). Time is relative to the point of gravity-stimulation and the signal of \emph{pUBQ10::YFP-PIP1;4}is shown. Due to a high dynamic range in grey values the brightness and contrast were adjusted non-linearly. Scale bar: 20 $\mu$m. Detailed recording metadata are listed in Table~\ref{tab:metadata}. {\bf D:} Exponential growth profile of the lateral root primordia. For each indicated dataset, the number of nuclei is plotted (blue curve) as a function of time points since gravistimulation (k: growth factor, T: doubling time). The red dashed line represents the fitted exponential curve.

{\bf Cell lineages of the five wild type datasets.} The nodes are colour-coded based on the corresponding division type: \textcolor{red}{anticlinal}, \textcolor{green}{periclinal} and \textcolor{blue}{radial}. Labels on the left show the time points and top labels display the total number of divisions. The trees framed with orange rectangles are the ones located in the master cell file of a dataset. The visualisation at the bottom of each tree allows a comparison of division sequences between different trees. Each column represents the division sequence of a cell until the last segmented time point. The number of columns corresponds to the total number of cells at the last segmented time point, whereas the number of rows indicates the total number of division rounds (e.g. the leftmost leaf cell in the top left tree in dataset \#120830 follows the division sequence anticlinal, anticlinal, periclinal and anticlinal).

Each cell nucleus is coloured according to the sequence of periclinal divisions. {\bf Bottom:} Division sequence trees along the number of cells.

{\bf Reconstruction of five wild type lateral root primordia and analysis of cell file information.} {\bf A:} For each dataset, the spatial distribution of cell nuclei is represented. The first and last time point of segmented nuclei as well as the 143-cell stage are shown in the front, radial and side views. Clonally related cells share the same colour which also indicates the cell file assignment. {\bf B:} First time point of the membrane channel in the front view. {\bf C:} Single cell initiation events are restricted to the periphery of the field of founder cells. A sketch of the position of the cell boundaries. Cells in the master cell file are coloured in light and dark green, respectively. The cells in the two flanking cell files are coloured in yellow or orange while the other cell files are illustrated in grey. The red arrowhead indicates founders not belonging to a pair of pericycle cells. {\bf D:} Correlation between the topology of endodermis cells and most contributing founders. The white-magenta dashed lines represent the contours of the overlaying endodermis cells. The blue arrowhead indicates the founder contributing most to the primordium. {\bf E:} Pericycle cell border positions relative to the actual centre. {\bf F:} Timing of each division per cell file for all datasets. For each round of division (sub panels cycle 1$, \ldots$, cycle 6), each cell division is plotted according to its cell file assignment and its time point of division. The dashed red box indicates the master cell file.

Three types of visualisation are used: cell contours (top), nuclei (middle) and adjacent cell layers (bottom). Colours indicate the layers generated by the sequence of periclinal divisions. The positions of the rendered spheres are given by the centres of mass of each cell. The third representation displays the cell layers between adjacent cells that share the same layer value. Cells are adjacent if they share at least one common cell wall. The lines are drawn for at least two cells through the centres of mass of the corresponding cells. At the bottom of each model, the value of the used area ratio, i.e. the maximal percentage increase of a cell before it divides (see Section~\ref{sec:timePointOfDivison}) as well as the average number of cells, anticlinal and periclinal divisions are listed for each model with 100 simulation runs.
